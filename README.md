Most Recent Tab
===============

Firefox extension that adds a keyboard shortcut to switch back to your most recently selected tab. Useful to alternate between two tabs and to easy go back to your last tab if you switch to another briefly.

This is rewrite built on Firefox's new [WebExtensions API](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/06/cross-browser-extensions-available-now-in-firefox/), replacing the old Addon SDK version.

It's distributed the [Firefox Addon site](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/most-recent-tab/), although the new version is currently awaiting review.

The code is licensed under the Mozilla Public License 2.0.
